## Project: Build a Portfolio Site - Udacity - NanoDegree Program Full Stack Web Developer

For this project, I have build with the use of HTML and CSS a portfolio website from a provided design PDF mockup file. This website is a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects I will complete through the course of the Nanodegree program. It has been build as part of the NanoDegree Full Stack Web Developer course on Udacity.
